Front-end Developer Test

##Test Instructions

The repo contains a basic starter html page. Replace this page with the creative (.psd) in the creative folder.
Build the creative using HTML5, Bootstrap, Font-Awsome and jQuery. The finished page should validate and dynamic aspects should work.
Once you have completed your build, create a new pull request.

If you don't know how to use Github to create a pull request, build the creative, zip it, and email it to your agency and they will send it on to us.
